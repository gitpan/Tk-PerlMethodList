Tk-PerlMethodList version 0.06
==========================


Tk::PerlMethodList is a Tk::Toplevel-derived widget.

The window contains entry fields for a classname and a regex. The list below displays the subroutine-names in the package(s) of the given classname and its parent classes. In case of imported subs, the last field of a row contains the name of the aliased sub as reported by DevelPeek::CvGV. Tk::PerlMethodList will not show subs which can be - but have not yet been autoloaded. It will show declared subs though. The 'Filter' entry takes a regex to filter the returned List of sub/methodnames.

If the file containing a subroutine definition can be found in %INC, a green mark will be displayed at the beginning of the line. The sourcecode will be displayed by clicking on the subs list-entry.


Method list and source window have Control-plus and Control-minus bindings to change fontsize.
