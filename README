Tk-PerlMethodList version 0.01
==========================

Tk::PerlMethodList is a Tk::Toplevel-derived widget.

The window contains entry fields for a classname and a regex. A list below displays the subroutine-names in the package(s) of the given classname and its parent classes. The list will contain the sub-names present in the the symbol-table. It will therefore display imported subs as well. For the same reason it will not show subs which can be - but have not yet been autoloaded. It will show declared subs though. The 'Filter' entry takes a regex to filter the returned List of sub/methodnames.

If the file containing a subroutine definition can be found in %INC, the sourcecode will be displayed by clicking on the subs list-entry.
